## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The project is built on a clean, layered architecture using industry-standard Microsoft and open-source technologies:

| Category | Technology / Pattern | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Framework** | **ASP.NET Core MVC** | Handles the web application structure and request pipeline. |
| **Database** | **SQL Server** | The primary relational data store. |
| **ORM** | **Entity Framework Core** | Used for database interaction via Code First approach. |
| **Design Pattern** | **Repository Pattern + Unit of Work** | Provides an abstraction layer for data access and ensures transaction integrity. |
| **Inversion of Control** | **Dependency Injection** | Core pattern for managing service lifecycles and decoupling components. |
| **Mapping** | **AutoMapper** | Used to simplify data transfer and mapping between **ViewModels** and **Entities**. |
| **Frontend** | **Bootstrap + Razor Views** | Used for the responsive and dynamic User Interface (UI). |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system adheres to a layered architecture for separation of concerns, making the codebase scalable and maintainable:

* **Presentation Layer (MVC):** Handled by **MVC Controllers** and **Razor Views**. This layer is responsible for routing user requests, validating input, and rendering the UI.
* **Business Logic Layer (Services):** Handled by the **Services** project. This is where the core logic resides, orchestrating data flow and applying business rules.
* **Data Access Layer:** Managed by the **Repository** pattern and **Entity Framework Core**. This layer abstracts database operations, ensuring clean access and manipulation of data entities.
